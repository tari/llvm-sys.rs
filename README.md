Rust bindings to LLVM's C API.

# Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
llvm-sys = "39"
```

There must be a compatible version of LLVM available. By default `llvm-sys`
will look for `llvm-config` on `PATH` to find a system-wide copy of LLVM and
use that if it is a compatible version. Custom options for finding LLVM
on your system can be specified via environment variables. See
[LLVM compatibility](#llvm-compatibility) for more information.

## Documentation

See the `examples` directory in this repository for API examples. There also
exist some other projects using these bindings which may be
informative:

 * [Tari's merthc](https://bitbucket.org/tari/merthc)
 * [Wilfred's BF compiler](https://crates.io/crates/bfc)

Most of the interfaces are not documented in these bindings. Refer to the
[LLVM documentation](http://llvm.org/docs/) for more information, particularly
the [generated API documentation](http://llvm.org/doxygen/).

If you have your own project using these bindings that you think is worth
mentioning here, by all means let me know.

## LLVM compatibility

Because the LLVM C [API stability guarantees][c-api-stability] are relatively
weak, this crate enforces that the LLVM release in use match the one it was made
for. The crate version is constructed by treating the LLVM version as a real
number and multiplying by 10, ignoring any fractional part. Thus `llvm-sys`
version 37 is compatible with LLVM 3.7.x, and `llvm-sys` 41 would be compatible
with LLVM 4.1.x.

[c-api-stability]: http://llvm.org/releases/3.8.0/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#c-api-changes

The following table is a compatibility matrix with LLVM versions (rows) and
versions of this crate (columns). ● denotes an exactly-compatible version, and ◑
is a binary-compatible version but with elements deprecated (implying that
movement to the next crate version in the same table row will still compile, but
may introduce new warnings).

| LLVM version | 36 | 37 | 38 | 39 |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|
| <3.6         |    |    |    |    |
| 3.6.x        | ●  |    |    |    |
| 3.7.0        |    |    |    |    |
| 3.7.x        |    | ●  |    |    |
| 3.8.x        |    | ◑  | ●  |    |
| 3.9.0        |    |    |    | ●  |

The build scripts will not enforce this compatibility matrix strictly,
permitting compilation against any version of LLVM that is at least as new as
the crate target version. This is safe in most cases because the LLVM C API is
meant to maintain binary compatibility across releases with the exception of
when functions are deprecated and later removed. An incompatible LLVM version
will generally fail to compile with a link-time error, rather than cause runtime
errors. Where versions are known to break binary compatibility, the build script
will prevent compilation.

Depending on your use of the C API, your program may require that only a
version of LLVM exactly matching your crate version be allowed. This can be set
with the cargo feature flag `strict-versioning` or by setting the environment
variable `LLVM_SYS_<version>_STRICT_VERSIONING` (where `<version>` is the target
crate version) to any value.

llvm-sys blacklists some versions of LLVM that are known to be
binary-incompatible. If you're feeling lucky, setting
`LLVM_SYS_<version>_IGNORE_BLACKLIST` to "YES" will permit the use of
blacklisted library versions (which may cause vexing bugs).

---

It may be difficult or even impossible to provide a compatible LLVM version
system-wide for a given project (consider a program using two libraries that
internally use different versions of LLVM!) so environment variables can be set
to help the build scripts find your copy of the libraries. This is also helpful
if you are unable to provide a system-wide version of LLVM but can still
compile it yourself.

`LLVM_SYS_<version>_PREFIX` specifies the install prefix for a compiled and
installed copy of the libraries, where `<version>` is the major version of
`llvm-sys` (for example, `LLVM_SYS_37_PREFIX`). For information on compiling
a copy of LLVM yourself, see [Compiling LLVM](#compiling-llvm).

In the future this library may offer the ability to download and compile LLVM
automatically, but such a feature should only be considered for building
one-off releases because its high cost is ill-suited to repeated builds.

## Compiling LLVM

While the [getting started guide](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html) is
the official guide to compiling LLVM, this section will attempt to provide
minimum guidance in creating usable libraries. If you encounter problems, refer
to the official documentation.

### Download sources

Download and unpack a copy of the source for the required version.

```sh
wget https://llvm.org/releases/3.9.0/llvm-3.9.0.src.tar.xz
tar xJf llvm-3.9.0.src.tar.xz
```

Note that you do not need to compile Clang or the test suite.

### Configure

Configure the build using [CMake][cmake] (you will need a copy of CMake
installed).

[cmake]: https://cmake.org/

```sh
mkdir -p llvm-3.9.0.src/build
cd llvm-3.9.0.src/build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/llvm-3.9.0
```

Some of the useful options that can be specified at configuration-time
(via `-D` passed to CMake):

 * `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` sets the location to install everything in the install
   step (later). In the above example this is under your home directory.
 * `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` specifies the build mode, one of Debug, Release,
   MinSizeRel or RelWithDebInfo. Unless you plan to debug LLVM itself,
   Release or MinSizeRel is probably a good choice.
 * `LLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS` enables internal sanity checks, highly recommended
   when writing and debugging your own program that uses LLVM because it can
   detect many usage errors that could otherwise result in hard-to-debug
   crashes.

Passing `-G <generator>` to CMake will make it use a different build system, but
by default it will select one appropriate to your system. If you have
[ninja][ninja] available, it is recommended due to its speed (`-G Ninja`).

[ninja]: https://ninja-build.org/

### Compile and install

```sh
cmake --build . --target install
```

This will automatically invoke the build system and copy binaries into the
prefix specified at configuration-time when done. Then you can compile llvm-sys
against it.

```sh
cd your/crate/path
LLVM_SYS_39_PREFIX=$HOME/llvm-3.9.0 cargo build
```

## Windows

You must use a version of Rust that uses the same compiler as you build LLVM
with, either MSVC or MinGW. Fortunately, a mismatch like this will cause errors
at compile-time when llvm-config provides options which are supported by only
one of them, so if you're using the other it will cause the build to fail.

## Cross-compilation

Will theoretically work, but hasn't been tested. Let us know if you try.
